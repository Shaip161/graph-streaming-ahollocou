# A Streaming Algorithm for Graph Clustering

This repository provides supplementary material and source code for the paper
**A Streaming Algorithm for Graph Clustering**
by Alexandre Hollocou, Julien Maudet, Thomas Bonald and Marc Lelarge.

The C++ version of the code that is used in our benchmarks can be found in the **cpp/** directory.

In the **python/** directory, you can find a Jupyter notebook that illustrates
the behaviour of the algorithm on a synthetic graph.
